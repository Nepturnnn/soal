To You, In the Future.
My Child,

By the time you read this, I will have been gone for a long time.
To you, I might be nothing more than a blurred memory from a childhood long past.

But know this: This message is not late. It is arriving exactly when it was meant to.
I wrote this over a decade ago, while you were still sleeping in my lap. I calculated the delivery factoring in time, your maturity, and your capabilities. so it would reach you today. Because by my calculations, today is the day you are finally ready.

The world thinks I took the secrets of "Project Aethelgard" to my grave.
They were wrong. I locked it away in a time capsule, waiting for the only person I could ever truly trust: You.

The terminal is locked. I didn't use any password from my era—that would be too easy to crack.
The key is between us, hidden within the digital breadcrumbs I left behind.

You might not remember, but I always taught you to look closer, didn't I?

Do not trust what is written on the surface of these files. That is merely a decoy for those who lack vision. Look at the childhood photo I’ve attached. Behind our smiles, I’ve quietly woven the most vital piece of the puzzle.

And remember my golden rule: People lie, and memories fade, but "history" never lies. The answer lies in the timeline. You must retrace my steps, sequence by sequence, until you find the exact moment of my breakthrough.

My algorithms are never wrong. I know you can solve this.

Good luck.
From Mom—sent from the past.
